## 💡 What is AMTM-OSR?
AMTM-OSR (Abandoned Scripts Revival) is a GitHub Organization dedicated to rescuing, maintaining, and improving scripts originally developed for ASUSWRT-Merlin (AMTM) routers that have fallen out of active maintenance. We provide a central home for these orphaned tools, ensuring they remain secure, compatible, and up-to-date.

## 📜 Our Mission
- **Revival:** Identify and fork legacy AMTM scripts that are no longer maintained.
- **Maintenance:** Apply bug fixes, security patches, and compatibility updates.
- **Collaboration:** Foster an open community where developers can contribute enhancements, documentation, and testing.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Browse Repositories**  
   Explore our [Repositories](https://github.com/AMTM-OSR) to see which scripts are currently hosted under our stewardship.
2. **Check Issues**  
   Visit the **Issues** tab on any repo to find open bugs, feature requests, or discussion threads.
3. **Contribute**  
   - Fork the target repository.
   - Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
   - Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
   - Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
   - Open a Pull Request detailing your updates.

## 🔧 Script Update Workflow
1. **Fork or Transfer**  
   Legacy script owner forks or gives admin access to AMTM-OSR.
2. **One Last Pull**  
   A final pull from the old repo ensures seamless transition of update URLs.
3. **Update Check**  
   AMTM scripts are configured to check against the new AMTM-OSR repo for future updates.
4. **Continuous Maintenance**  
   Community members monitor, patch, and release new versions under semantic versioning.

## 📢 Communication Channels
- **Discussions & Issues:** Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature proposals.
- **Pull Requests:** Submit code, docs, or test enhancements via PRs.
- **Community Forum:** Join our SNBForums thread: [AMTM-OSR on SNBForums](https://www.snbforums.com/forums/amtm-osr)
